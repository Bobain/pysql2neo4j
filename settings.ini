;Mandatory
;Directory where csv files are to be saved
; additionnaly when running with offline=0
; you'll need to comment dbms.directories.import=import in your neo4j conf file
; (stackoverflow says to : dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=true do not know if thats of any use but did it as it is the answer google finds you)
; sudo vim /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf to edit conf file
; sudo neo4j restart

;Mandatory
;Maximum rows per csv file.
csv_row_limit=10000

# < Bobain's edit
;Optional
; the list of tables to export. If nothing provided then all tables would be exported
; I needed this because strings seem to be poorly handled in Neo4j : I had an error because of a string containing a quote
; finally needed to edit configman : STR2REPLACE in order to replace some characters as I had a string filed in a table
; which contains quotes
; at least you can speed up export/import by restricting to some tables
tables_to_export=users,contributions,projects

;Optional
; reuse previously generated csv and cypher files:
; suppose you already have exported files either with offline mode or with a previous run (which failed in import )
; then set this to 1 to make the script skip export phase and go directly to import
skip_export=1

;Optional
;Periodic commit on Neo4j

;Optional
;Should the program change the case of table's name before applying it to the node's label?
;Available Options:
;    capitalize (default)
;    none (do nothing)
;label_transform=capitalize

;Optional
;Default relation name is 'primarykeytable_foreignkeytable'
;Should the program change the case;
;Available Options:
;    allcaps (default)
;    none (do nothing)
;relation_type_transform=allcaps

;Optional
;If set to 1 it will not transfer redundant fields i.e. fields belonging to foreign keys
;and that are not part of a foreign key
;Available Options:
;	1/Any other value (Yes - default)
;	0 (No)
;remove_redundant_fields=1

;Optional
;If set to 1, then tables who are there to implement a many-to-many relationship
;between two tables (that is: tables who refer two only tables and whose primary
;key is composed by two foreign keys to those tables) will not be transferred 
;as nodes but as relationships. The columns of the table will become properties 
;of the relationship
;Available Options:
;	1/Any other value (Yes - default)
;	0 (No)
;many_to_many_as_relation=1

;Do not perform any actions, only connect to the databases and simulate migration

;The section below is optional and sets options relevant to offline mode. In offline 
;mode, no import to Neo4j will be performed. Instead, it will produce all necessary
;CSVs together with a cypher script to perform the import on a different machine
[OFFLINE_MODE]

;Available Options:
;	1(Yes)
;	0/Any other value  (No-default)

;Just in case you want it somewhere else
;Default: same as csv_directory

;If we want to run the script on a different machine, the CSVs will most probably
;be on a different directory. You can specify here the target directory and save
